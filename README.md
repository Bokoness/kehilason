# Kehilashon

The "Kehilashon" project is a social initiative aimed at helping individuals and communities change their speech habits and language preservation. Using a shared timetable, each participant allocates one hour during which they commit not to engage in gossip and harmful speech, thus "buying their world in one hour." Even though guarding one's tongue may seem like a difficult task, even impossible for an individual, we believe that for a community and the public, it is an attainable goal, as Moses expressed, "For this commandment that I command you today is not too hard for you, neither is it far off" (Deuteronomy 30:11).
Project Goals (excerpt from the project's goals):
Raise awareness about the importance of preserving language and promoting good speech.
Provide technological and social tools to facilitate changes in the speech habits of individuals and communities.
Lead social change and create a society that engages in better speech.
